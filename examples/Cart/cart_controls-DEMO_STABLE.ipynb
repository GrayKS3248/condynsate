    "This is the model of the cart. There are two generalized coordinates: $\\theta$ (the pendulum angle) and $\\phi$ (the wheel angle). Because we assume that all the wheels are rolling without slipping, each wheel has the same angle. Further, the $x$ coordinate of the cart can be expressed in terms of the wheel angle and the radius of the wheels, $r$. Lastly, the input to the system is some torque, $\\tau$, that is applied equally to all the wheels."
