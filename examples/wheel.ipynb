    "Now that all the helper functions are defined, we can run the simulation loop. This simulation will start running when the user presses the 'enter' and continue running until the user presses the 'esc' key. During the simulation, the user can set the target angle of the wheel (indicated by the orange arrow) with the 'q' and 'e' keys. A PD controll will then apply torque to the wheel axle to attempt to enforce this angle based on a set of proportional and derivatve control gains. The proportional control gains can be adjusted by the user with the 'f' and 'r' keys and the derivative control gains can be adjusted with the 'g' and 't' keys. The animator plots the target and current wheel angle is plotted as a function of time as well as the current values of the control gains."
