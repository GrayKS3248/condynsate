CONDYNSATE
==========

**condynsate** (/con'din'sate/) is a simulation and visualization tool built on PyBullet_ and MeshCat_.  It provides real-time, nonlinear simulation and browser-based visualization of multiple stl_ or obj_ rigid bodies and\or urdf_ defined articulated bodies in a Python environment. It was built by `G. Schaer`_ during the 2023 Fall semester at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under the Grainger College of Engineering 2023-2025 Strategic Instructional Innovations Program: Computational Tools for Dynamics and Control grant_. condynsate is optimized for education and promotes easy in-class demonstrations and lab demos without the need for physical equipment. Further, it encourages students to activate motor neurons by a mimicking play in a familiar video game inspired environment which is `beneficial to the processes of memory and learning during education`_.
