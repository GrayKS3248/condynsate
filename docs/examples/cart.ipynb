    "Next we want to build a function that updates the first line plot. We want this function to add a single datum to the end of the data list being plotted as a line. To do this, we will use the `condynsate.Simulator.add_line_datum` function. The arguments to this function are the plot to which the point is added and the (x,y) coordinates of the point. The x coordinate will be simulation time which we extract with `condynsate.Simulator.time`, and the y coordinate is the torque we calculated in the previous function. After `condynsate.Simulator.add_line_datum` is called, the animator automatically updates to add the point at the specified frame rate."
